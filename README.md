## ABOUT THE PROJECT 🧶

The exam track:

Reach17 is a UN target-based training platform that will need to catalogue the courses it offers.

Your task will be to implement RESTful JSON APIs that will manage the input of these courses. You do not need to develop a front end for this project.

My work:

- To train the front-end skills and the integration with a back-end created by me, however, I also developed the application from a graphic point of view, not taking care of it 100% and not following some patterns and optimizations but still creating a good front-end that allows you to test all functions.
- I modified some design requirements to improve the app according to my point of view, for example deciding to implement some features working with the IDs of the records inside the DB rather than with other course parameters
- I designed an alternative association system for courses that permit the teacher to request an association to an university and that association can be accepted by the university
- Since the UI Project was optional, to speed up the design process some stylistic elements such as the palette, the logo and some standard front-end components were created with Chat GPT to try the prompt-approach for simple coding tasks

## USAGE❓

⚠️ Be careful: since this is a simple MVP created as a demo/study project the infrastracture is hosted on free service providers, so it’s slow ⚠️

On the Reach 17 platform you can register with three different roles: as a student (who takes advantage of the courses), as a professor (who holds and organizes the courses) and as a university contact person (who hosts, organizes and manages the courses).

As a university contact person, you will be able to access the list of your courses, with the possibility of modifying or deleting them. If you are a new user, you can create new ones or accept the course proposal from a professor with the "Approve a course" function, and you can also view the list of your students with their matriculation number.

As a professor you will have the possibility to create courses, every time you create a course the request for association with the university will be automatically made. You can apply for association with a new university through your home page, where you can also view requests awaiting approval.
Within your profile you will also have a dashboard that will allow you to view your courses, edit them, delete them and check which students are enrolled.
